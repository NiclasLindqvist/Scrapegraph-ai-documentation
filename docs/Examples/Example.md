# ðŸ‘½ Example
First of all you have to install the library 
```python
pip install scrapegraphai
```
## Python code
SmartScraper is a class representing one of the default scraping pipelines. It uses a direct graph implementation where each node has its own function, from retrieving html from a website to extracting relevant information based on your query and generate a coherent answer.

```python
from scrapegraphai.graphs import SmartScraper

OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOURAPIKEY"

llm_config = {
    "api_key": OPENAI_API_KEY,
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
}

smart_scraper = SmartScraper("List me all the titles and project descriptions",
                             "https://perinim.github.io/projects/", llm_config)

answer = smart_scraper.run()
print(answer)
