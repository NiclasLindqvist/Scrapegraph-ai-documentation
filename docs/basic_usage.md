### Case 1: Extracting information using a prompt

You can use the `SmartScraper` class to extract information from a website using a prompt.

The `SmartScraper` class is a direct graph implementation that uses the most common nodes present in a web scraping pipeline. For more information, please see the [documentation](https://scrapegraph-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```python
from scrapegraphai.graphs import SmartScraper

OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

llm_config = {
    "api_key": OPENAI_API_KEY,
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
}

smart_scraper = SmartScraper("List me all the titles and project descriptions",
                             "https://perinim.github.io/projects/", llm_config)

answer = smart_scraper.run()
print(answer)
```

The output will be a dictionary with the extracted information, for example:

```bash
{
    'titles': [
        'Rotary Pendulum RL'
        ],
    'descriptions': [
        'Open Source project aimed at controlling a real life rotary pendulum using RL algorithms'
        ]
}
```
